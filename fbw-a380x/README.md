# A380X Project Files

The project directory is structured as follows:

```
- docs            <Specific docs for the project>
- src             <src files required for the project>
- out             <MSFS package folder after the build>
```

The `out` folder can be deleted as it is completely recreated during the build. This is essentially a clean build.
