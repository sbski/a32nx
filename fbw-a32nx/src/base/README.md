# MSFS Package Source Files

`flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo`: Original source files for the MSFS aircraft package for the A32NX.

`flybywire-aircraft-a320-neo-lock-highlight`: As per default the A32NX deactivates the blue highlighting 
of controls when using the new interaction mode. This is a small mod that users can put into the 
Community folder to turn the highlighting back on.

These directories are copied to the `out` directory during the build process.
